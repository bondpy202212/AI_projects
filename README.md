# AI_projects

**0_Paradigm ML and DL with the NN one neuron:**\
the difference between traditional programming and machine learning, how to use dense layers, loss functions, optimizers, and model.fit

**1_Computer Vision(CV) with the MNIST Dataset and Callbacks:**\
the Fashion MNIST dataset, how to use 10 output neurons in the neural network, ReLU function, callbacks parameter, and how to split data into training and test sets

**2_Convolutional Neural Networks in CV:**\
how convolutions improve image recognition and impact training in our deep neural network, also how the pooling technique is applied to images, convolution filters, for example, the function Conv1D(), and max pooling

**2__Basic convolution on a 2D grayscale image:**\
how convolution filters and max pooling work with a photo example

**3_CV with Real-world Images:**\
how to use Image Generator to label images, normalize the image, understand its parameters, how it helps remove some convolutions to handle smaller images, and what overfitting is

**4_CV with Real-world Images(Cats vs Dogs Dataset):**\
to do this, use the famous Kaggle Dogs v Cats dataset and create a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow and use Keras image preprocessing utilities such as flow_from_directory on ImageDataGenerator. It also discusses how to access the accuracy and loss values, showing how these parameters change during model training, which resulted in the discovery of model overfitting.
